# Overview

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a flexible and scalable infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling applications seamlessly across clusters of servers.

Nana Janashia's Kubernetes Tutorial (https://youtu.be/s_o8dwzRlu4?feature=shared) covers all the core concepts, including the main Kubernetes components that we need to learn to work efficiently with Kubernetes. I've learnt the syntax and contents of K8s configuration file , which is used to create and configure components in a Kubernetes cluster as well as how to setup a K8s cluster locally with minikube. There is also a hands-on demo project, where we get to learn how to deploy a web application with its database into a local Kubernetes cluster. It's a simple but realistic application setup, which can also serve as a blueprint configuration for most common application setups.
